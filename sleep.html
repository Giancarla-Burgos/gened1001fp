    <h1>You Chose to Sleep</h1>

    <p>You closed your eyes with the weight of the day pressing hard against your chest. The hum of the night was soft, the quiet stretching far too long. Eventually, you drifted off, body still tense, thoughts halfway caught in dread.</p>

    <p>Morning came. Pale grey light touched the hallway carpet. You were the first to rise, but the house didn’t feel right. There was no coffee on. No quiet footsteps pacing the floor. No soft cough behind the closed door.</p>

    <p>You checked the kitchen. The window was open. The wind pulled at the corner of the letter you’d left beside the drawer where you hid the ticket.</p>

    <p>The drawer was open. The ticket was gone.</p>

    <p>The kids found you minutes later, still staring at the empty space. The youngest asked, “Where’s Mom?” But you didn’t know what to say. Not yet.</p>

    <p>You checked the closet. A bag was missing. Her boots were gone. So was the silence between the two of you — broken, irreparably, by choice.</p>

    <p>She left you. She left them. She chose the ticket.</p>
