    <h1>Aftermath: Fractured Family</h1>

    <p>The house is still. But it’s not quiet.</p>

    <p>Your daughter stomps through the hallways like she’s daring something to stop her. Every word she says now has an edge. She used to smile at you.
      Now, it’s a glare. Or worse, silence sharpened into something cruel. You didn’t know she had that in her.</p>

    <p>Your son doesn’t speak much. He watches. And when he does glance your way, it’s like he’s searching for a version of you he no longer recognizes. 
      He hasn’t cried, not that you’ve seen. But his eyes are red more often than not. There’s grief there, and confusion. Maybe even fear.</p>

    <p>They know. Not the details. But enough. Enough to step around certain rooms like they hold ghosts.</p>

    <p>You loved them. You still do. You always will. That doesn’t change the fact that you did what had to be done. 
      Survival isn’t elegant. It’s not noble. It’s necessary.</p>

    <p>And in the quiet, sometimes you find yourself thinking, not about regret, but about how oddly peaceful it was afterward.
      How easy it was to sleep. How no one argues anymore. How quiet has become your favorite sound.</p>

    <p> After all, the world has gone to chaos. Who's there to stop you? Everyone's just trying to fend for themselves. </p>
