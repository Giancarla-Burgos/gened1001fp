      Dear Resident,
      
      <br><br>
      As part of the Phase One Evacuation Directive, the Unified States of Redro Wen will initiate a public auction for verified relocation tickets. 

      <br><br>
      Due to the extreme scarcity of space-bound capacity, ticket allocation will be offered through a merit-based, asset-weighted bidding system. 
      Citizens in good standing may participate by submitting verified bids through the Secure Civic Exchange Portal. 
      Bids must include an up-front monetary pledge in Redro Wen Credits (RWC), and may be supplemented by authorized assets such as intellectual property, labor bonds, or family legacy contributions.

      <br><br>
      Minimum bid requirements will be reviewed and adjusted quarterly in accordance with inflation, fuel availability, and ongoing vessel maintenance overhead. 
      Note: historic indicators suggest initial bids will exceed 400,000 RWC per person.

      <br><br>
      While all citizens are encouraged to participate, priority access will be granted to high-tier contributors, resource magnates, 
      essential government personnel, and legacy contract holders. Individuals unable to meet financial minimums may apply for reduced-fee review via the Secondary Allocation Lottery.

      <br><br>
      This initiative is not only designed to ensure the logistical viability of evacuation efforts, but to serve as a self-sustaining funding mechanism for outbound vessel construction, 
      propulsion reserves, and onboard survival infrastructure. All proceeds will directly support Phase Two expansion efforts and future civilian welfare initiatives.

      <br><br>
      For comprehensive application guidance, audit protections, or payment certifications, visit your nearest Treasury-Linked Processing Annex or contact your Regional Compliance Officer.
