  <h1>Novel Virus Discovered in Springfield</h1>
  <div class="byline">By J. Doe | April 3248 | Global Science Tribune</div>
  <div class="columns">
    <p>Authorities have confirmed the emergence of a new unidentified virus near the edges of the Calveth Forest. Locals reported symptoms ranging from confusion and sleepwalking to hallucinations and unexplained memory flashes. Scientists are scrambling to analyze samples as the affected population remains quarantined.</p>
    <p>Residents have begun calling it “The Mind Fog.” While speculation spreads online, no official name has been assigned. Eyewitnesses claim early symptoms appeared shortly after the installation of a new comms relay tower, though no official link has been made. Local health units have reported more than 30 suspected cases in the past week alone.</p>
    <p>Social media has amplified concerns, circulating videos allegedly showing individuals speaking in unfamiliar languages or referencing non-existent memories. While some experts warn of misinformation, others urge urgent study of the syndrome’s potential neurological impact.</p>
