  <h1>Fourth Confirmed Case of Novel "Zombie Virus" in Springfield</h1>
  <div class="byline">By J. Doe | July XXXX | New Times </div>
  <div class="columns">
    <p> The National Health Department has confirmed four isolated cases of a novel "zombie virus" in Springfield, according to a statement released Wednesday by New Times affilate PNN. </p>
    <p> All four patients are in quarantine at Springfield General Hospital. Health officials describe their conditions as stable but unusual.
      Symptoms include widespread rashes on skin, moderate to severe headaches, fatigue, nausea, and patches of discoloration of skin. 
      In two cases, patients exhibited "neurological disorientation", though the cause remains unclear. </p>
    <p> "We are taking this seriously, and there is no current cause for alarm", said Dr. Ben Smith, Chief Epidemiologist at the National Health Department. 
    "These cases are all under diligent investigation, and there no direct evidence currently supporting airborne transmission." </p>
    <p> Springfield residents have been advised to stay calm but alert. 
      Springfield city officials have been coordinating closely with federal health agencies proactively responding to the new biological threat.
      While officials are prepared to respond to this virus, they stress that a full citywide lockdown is not necessary. </p>
    <p> The Institutes for Infection Control (IIC) is expected to release further information following lab analysis of blood and tissue samples. </p>
