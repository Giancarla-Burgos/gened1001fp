      <h2>Welcome to the Truth</h2>
      <p class="content">
        You've stumbled upon something you weren't supposed to find, didn't you？What they don’t want you to know is that the "Zombie Virus" isn't what the media tells you. 
        It's not some natural outbreak, nor is it an accident. This is an orchestrated event. This is a CONTROLLED RELEASE!!!!!!!! 
        <span class="highlight">The virus itself is a COVER UP</span> because the truth lies beneath the surface, and it’s darker than you could ever imagine.
      </p>
      
      <div class="subheading">The True Origin of the Virus</div>
      <p class="content">
        This “Zombie Virus” began as an experiment. A government-backed bioengineering project gone horribly wrong in enemy territory, Korinthia. 
        Scientists, hidden in top-secret labs, were attempting to create a BIOWEAPON. What they unleashed was far beyond their control. But that’s not even the worst part. 
        <span class="emphasis">The real danger is NOT the VIRUS, it is, in fact, what it was meant to cover up.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="subheading">The Infected Are Not Just Sick</div>
      <p class="content">
        The people who have been infected by this "virus" are not truly sick, rather they are subjects of an immoral, illegal experiment. 
        Subjects being controlled and manipulated, their minds altered, all part of a larger experiment in human modification. 
        The infected are just a small piece of a much darker puzzle.
      </p>

      <div class="subheading">Suppression of Truth</div>
      <p class="content">
        Important evidence is being destroyed. Whistleblowers who’ve tried to expose the truth have been SILENCED!!!!! 
        YOU'RE NOT HEARING THE FULL STORY!!!!!
      </p>

      <div class="subheading">What You Don’t Know Could Kill You</div>
      <p class="content">
        The truth is out there but it’s all being hidden from you. You need to wake up before it’s too late. 
        This isn’t just a virus. It’s the first step of a larger plan that you are already caught up in. 
        The clock is ticking. What will you do when the truth comes crashing down?
        Let us FIGHT AGAINST THE KORINTHIANS!!! ALL OF THEM!!!! UNTIL THE END!!!!
