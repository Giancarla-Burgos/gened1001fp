    <h1>Layered Loss</h1>

    <p>You didnâ€™t just lose your spouse that night. You lost the rhythm of your mornings, the soft arguments over coffee, the way the kids used to laugh louder when both of you were in the room.</p>

    <p>In the days that followed, no one argued over breakfast anymore. Not because there was peace, but because there was nothing left to say.</p>

    <p>There was no clear answer. Only the weight of what was once possible was left behind, and the silence of what could have been.</p>
