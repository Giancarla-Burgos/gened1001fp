    <h1>You Chose Yourself</h1>

    <p>You remember warmth from once upon a time, in your former spouse’s laugh, in your daughter’s innocent eyes, in your son’s steady voice. 
      You remember it because it’s gone now.</p>

    <p> You chose what everyone says they never would. You chose yourself over your entire family. Everyone who ever loved you is death or left back in a self-destructing society.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t out of fear. Not really. It was something simpler. The understanding that you could still move while the others wept. 
      That sacrifice, when viewed from the top of the lifeboat, is easier to accept.</p>

    <p>People speak of guilt like it’s a weight. But it hardens you, building strength. 
      The person who boarded the ship is not the one who used to kiss scraped knees and say “I’ll protect you.”</p>

    <p>You survived. They didn’t. And for once, you don’t feel sorry. You feel ready.</p>
