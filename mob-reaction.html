    <h1>The Turning Point</h1>

    <p>It wasn’t supposed to happen like this. You told yourself it wouldn’t. That people would understand. That they’d see what he did as love.</p>

    <p>But from the moment you opened your door in broad daylight, it didn’t take long. Not in a place where belief spreads faster than reason. The church bells rang that night, but not for a sermon. Just a signal.</p>

    <p>You saw the torchlight first. Then the shouting. By the time you processed it all, they already knocked down your door. A teacher, someone who once gave your elementary-aged son candy when he got straight As, screamed first.</p>

    <p>“He gave it up. For him. For a sickness.”</p>

    <p>Your son's lover stepped outside. Hands up. Eyes steady. He didn’t run. He just looked at you, like he already knew. Like he was pleading for your forgiveness.</p>

    <p>Because the moment they laid eyes on you all together, they decided what had to be down.</p>

    <p>It would all be quiet soon.</p>
