    <h1>The Turning Point</h1>

    <p>It wasn’t supposed to happen like this. You told yourself it wouldn’t. That people would understand. That they’d see what he did as love.</p>

    <p>But when the town found out, it didn’t take long. Not in a place where belief spreads faster than reason. The church bells rang that night, but not for a sermon. Just a signal.</p>

    <p>You saw the torchlight first. Then the shouting. By the time you opened the door, they were already on the lawn. A face you recognized — your neighbor, a teacher, someone who once gave your son candy when he got straight As — screamed first.</p>

    <p>“He gave it up. For him. For a sickness (lover is part of "hostile group").”</p>

    <p>The lover stepped outside. Hands up. Eyes steady. He didn’t run. He just looked at you, like he already knew. Like he forgave you in advance for what came next.</p>

    <p>You held your son back. He was screaming. He didn’t stop until the screaming outside did.</p>

    <p>And then it was quiet.</p>

    <p>The mob left a body and a silence. But they took something else with them too. Maybe your son’s faith. Maybe your own.</p>

    <p>He hasn’t spoken since.</p>

    <p>And now you have to decide what comes next. He won’t move. Won’t eat. You’ve tried. But tomorrow the transport leaves.</p>
