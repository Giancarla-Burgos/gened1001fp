    <div class="heading">Be Prepared for Anything</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>In these uncertain times, it’s vital to stay prepared, calm, and organized. This guide will help you stay in control of your survival.</p>

      <div class="subheading">1. Build a Tight Circle</div>
      <p class="content">Choose a small, reliable group of friends or family. Stay close, communicate regularly, and ensure everyone is on the same page regarding safety protocols.</p>

      <div class="subheading">2. Set Up Communication Channels</div>
      <p class="content">In case of network failure, ensure you have multiple methods to reach your group. 
        Encrypted messaging apps or walkie-talkies can be crucial for communication when traditional channels go down. 
        Make sure everyone knows the primary and secondary contact methods.</p>

      <div class="subheading">3. Stockpile Essential Resources</div>
      <p class="content">You don’t need to hoard everything, but having a stockpile of essentials can make all the difference. 
        Focus on non-perishable food, clean water, hygiene supplies, and basic medical kits.</p>

      <div class="subheading">4. Know Your Safe Zones</div>
      <p class="content">Identify safe zones within your area, places that can be used for refuge in case of an emergency. 
        These should be away from heavily populated areas, easily accessible, and well-guarded (e.g., basements, secure buildings, etc.).</p>

      <div class="subheading">5. Trust Your Instincts</div>
      <p class="content">In times of crisis, you’ll be forced to make decisions quickly. Trust your gut when something doesn’t feel right. 
        Avoid crowds, stay alert, and don't hesitate to act on your instincts. Survival often depends on split-second decisions.</p>

      <div class="subheading">6. Avoid Public Panic</div>
      <p class="content">As the situation escalates, public panic can spread faster than the virus itself.
        If you remain calm and rational, others will often follow your lead. 
        Be the voice of reason in times of fear, but never compromise your own safety or the safety of your group.</p>

      <div class="subheading">7. Secure Your Home</div>
      <p class="content">Lock all doors and windows, and if possible, reinforce your entry points with barricades. 
        Even if things seem calm, it’s important to prepare your home to withstand unexpected breaches. 
        Be ready for lockdown situations where you may need to stay inside for extended periods.</p>

      <div class="subheading">8. Monitor News from Reliable Sources</div>
      <p class="content">Stick to trusted, factual sources of information. The chaos often leads to rumors and misinformation. 
        Ensure you have access to reliable news channels or alternative communication like emergency broadcasts that can keep you updated.</p>

      <div class="subheading">9. Develop an Evacuation Plan</div>
      <p class="content">Know the fastest routes out of your town or city, and plan where you can go if you need to leave. 
        Have a pre-prepared bag with essential items (important documents, cash, clothes, etc.). Don’t wait until the last minute.</p>

      <div class="subheading">10. Keep a Level Head</div>
      <p class="content">In moments of panic or uncertainty, your mental state is just as important as your physical survival. 
        Practice mindfulness techniques and take moments to breathe. Clear thinking is your best tool when everything seems to be falling apart.</p>
