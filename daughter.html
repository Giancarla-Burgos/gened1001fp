    <h1>You Chose Your Daughter</h1>

    <p>She was always the kindest hearted. Even when things were already crumbling, she kept offering, listening, apologizing for things that weren’t her fault to her community.</p>

    <p>You found her lockbox after she boarded. Beneath her research notes and worn-out textbooks, there was a letter she never meant you to read. It wasn’t addressed to anyone. Just thoughts on paper, folded neatly like something sacred.</p>

    <p><em>“If I go,”</em> it began, <em>“I’ll try to help build something better. Perfect is unrealistic. Just better is enough. I hope, wherever I go, my family finds peace, even if I never see them again.”</em></p>

    <p>She didn’t ask for salvation. She just asked for a chance to do some good. And that, more than anything, is why she was one you could live with saving.</p>
