    <h1>Your Son</h1>
    <p>He always did everything right. Perfect grades. Steady hands. You told everyone he was going to be a doctor, and he's so close to the finish line. 
      Or was, before the world began to break around him.</p>

    <p>He hasn’t said much lately. Even more time in his room. Even more time outside, but never telling you where. 
      You used to think you knew him. But these days, it feels like he’s slipping through your fingers, like mist.</p>

    <p>You chose him. Of course you did. You told yourself it was logical that he could help others. But deep down, you knew the truth: he was your favorite. He always had been.</p>
