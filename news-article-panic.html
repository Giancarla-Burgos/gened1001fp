    <div class="title">Neuroviral Encephalopathia: The Global Crisis We Didn’t See Coming</div>

    <div class="timestamp">By J. Doe | May 2025 | New Times</div>

    <p class="content">
      The Redro Wen National Health Department has confirmed multiple cases of the newly identified Neuroviral Encephalopathia (NVE), informally referred to as "Zombie Virus" 
      a virus that has been linked to terrifying neurological symptoms and a disturbing transformation of its victims. 
      While the media initially downplayed the outbreak, recent reports suggest that the situation is far more alarming than initially anticipated. 
      The cases, first identified in Springfield, Redro Wen have rapidly spread across several nations, most notably Korinthia, and the virus’ true origin is still shrouded in mystery. 
      Experts are scrambling to understand the virus, and the true scale of its impact is still unfolding. Public health officials are working tirelessly to trace the virus' origins, 
      but with each passing day, the situation becomes increasingly dire.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      What was first believed to be a localized infection has now spread across multiple regions, with the true scope of the crisis still unclear. 
      As Redro Wen hospitals report an influx of patients presenting with strange neurological symptoms, such as severe memory loss, hallucinations, and fatigue, 
      public concern has grown to new heights. The virus, which seems to cause the transformation of ordinary people into lethargic, disoriented individuals, 
      has sparked panic not only in Korinthia but in neighboring nations. In some cases, entire towns have been forced into quarantine as a precautionary measure, 
      adding to the fear and confusion. Local governments are struggling to maintain order as the number of infected individuals rises.

    <div class="quote">
      "The virus is only the beginning. What's about to happen next is what we should be worried about."

    <p class="content">
      Meanwhile, scientists and human rights advocates are scrambling to assess the real cause of the outbreak, especially as many have been using it to weaponize against Korinthians 
      in Redro Wen. Many claim that the virus is not a natural occurrence but a bioweapon intentionally unleashed to reduce the population and consolidate power under the regime. 
      The human cost of the outbreak is already catastrophic, but perhaps more disturbing is the way marginalized communities have been disproportionately affected by both
      the disease and the government's response. Reports from refugee camps and low-income neighborhoods suggest that the infected are being segregated and left to die in isolation, 
      with government forces turning a blind eye to the suffering. This has prompted widespread outrage and calls for international intervention to prevent further atrocities.

      "The media blackout on these issues is not a coincidence. These people are being abandoned."

      <p class="content">
      Foreign Korinthian government officials have remained silent about the true origins of the virus, 
      but the Korinthian's In Soliditary Association (abbreviated KISA) has repeatedly referred to the outbreak as "the rapture". 
      Citizens have begun to speak of the virus as a divine punishment, a manifestation of the Korinthian Prophecy, 
      an apocalyptic belief system that has gained a frightening amount of influence in the region. According to this belief, 
      Neuroviral Encephalopathia is not just a virus—it is a test of faith, a reckoning before the great judgment day. 
      The virus itself is believed to be God's punishment upon the unworthy, a reflection of their own sins.
      The Prophecy teaches that only the faithful will survive the coming trials, and some even view the virus as a form of purification for those deemed unworthy.
    </p>

    
    <p class="content">
      As the virus spreads and the religious fervor intensifies, a cult-like mentality has also begun to form. 
      Many followers of the Korinthian religion have begun to view the infected not as victims but as "chosen ones," people who are undergoing a form of spiritual purification. 
      The Korinthian religion, known as Revelatorism, bases its teachings on a book of revelations written by their founder, High Prophet Korin, 
      who claimed to have had visions of the end of the world. These visions, which were described in The Final Seal of the Final Scroll, 
      speak of a world in chaos, filled with disease, suffering, and a final cleansing. According to the followers of this belief, 
      the virus is a sign that the Last Days have arrived, and only the faithful will survive the impending apocalypse. 
      It’s a doctrine steeped in fear, encouraging believers to follow the path of sacrifice, asceticism, and devotion to the Korinthian Church. 
      The followers see the current pandemic not as a natural disaster but as an integral part of their religious journey.
      This belief has led to a rise in extremism within religious communities, some even advocating for the forced isolation or elimination of those deemed unworthy. 
      These cult-like groups are growing in influence, using the virus as a rallying cry to bring in more followers, promising salvation in exchange for unwavering faith in the doctrine. As more people are swept into the fervor, the lines between religion and politics begin to blur, leading to increasingly dangerous ideologies.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      Those in charge, meanwhile, have been using the virus as a smokescreen for their agenda. As the virus spreads, so does fear, 
      with surveillance systems being installed in cities under the guise of public health safety and causing suspicion of Korinthians living in the country. 
      “The virus is not the threat,” said a local activist. “The threat is these people coming to infect our children".
    </p>

     <p class="content">
      Human rights organizations are now calling for the international community to take action, warning that the outbreak is being used as an excuse for discrimination and ethnic cleansing. 
      “We are seeing an alarming rise in Korinthianism in the government's response to this crisis,” said a spokesperson from the Redro Wen Human Rights Watch. 
       “Certain minorities are being treated as expendable, with little regard for their survival.” While the virus is a dangerous new biological threat, 
       the social consequences may be even worse. The divisiveness in the government's response is fostering distrust between communities, 
       and Korinthian infected are often left to fend for themselves in the most desolate conditions.
