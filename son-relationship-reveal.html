    <h1>The Truth Comes to Light</h1>

    <p>It started with a knock at the door.</p>

    <p>You weren’t expecting anyone, not this late. Your son was upstairs, headphones on, pretending the world didn’t exist. 
      When you opened the door, there he was eyes wide, voice trembling.</p>

    <p>“I’m sorry for coming here,” he said. “But he hasn’t told you, has he?”</p>

    <p>It didn’t take long for the truth to come to light. The stranger wasn’t a stranger. He was the one your son loved, and the one your son had given his ticket to.</p>

    <p>“I tried to talk him out of it. He said he couldn’t let me die. I'm the one registered and I'd like to be with him for these last few moments”</p>

    <p>You wanted to scream. Instead, you stood frozen. Because what do you do when your child sacrifices himself for someone the world won’t even recognize as worthy of a seat? 
      The moment you laid eyes on him, it was obvious he was a Korinthian. </p>
