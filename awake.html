    <h1>You Stayed Awake</h1>
    <p>The house was quiet. Outside, the wind dragged leaves across the deck like whispers trying to warn you. You sat in the silence, something gnawing at your thoughts. You weren’t sure why you couldn’t sleep—but now you know.</p>

    <p>The kitchen light flickered on. You stayed still in the shadows of the hallway. A figure moved across the tile. It was your spouse. They were sliding open the drawer, the one where you hid the ticket. You hadn’t told anyone it had arrived—not even them.</p>

    <p>But they already knew.</p>

    <p>You waited. Watched. They pulled it out, held it in the light. No hesitation. No regret.</p>

    <p>“I’m sorry,” they whispered to no one. "They'll understand. Someone had to make the hard choice.”</p>

    <p>That's when you stepped forward.</p>

    <p>“So it was you,” you said. Calmly. Quietly.</p>

    <p>The look on their face was part shock, part sorrow. No anger. Just a final understanding.</p>

    <p>You didn’t speak again. You didn’t have to. The survival instinct took over, and by the time the sun rose, you were the only one left standing.</p>

    <p>The ticket was in your pocket. The floor behind you was cold.</p>
