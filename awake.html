    <h1>You Stayed Awake</h1>
  
    <p>From the hallway, you watched the soft hum of the kitchen light flicker to life. Your spouse stood in front of the drawer — <em>the</em> drawer. The one no one else knew about.</p>
  
    <p>The family's sole ticket glinted in their hand before they even opened it fully. Like they'd rehearsed it. </p>
  
    <p>No pause. No second thought. They held it up to the light like a passport to a future only they were meant to reach. You could barely hear them, but the words cut clean:</p>
  
    <p><em>“I’m sorry. Someone had to choose.”</em></p>
  
    <p>You didn’t move. Not at first. You let the silence expand between you, like a waiting room with no answers. Then, slowly, you stepped forward.</p>
  
    <p><em>“How dare you.”</em></p>
  
    <p>Their eyes found yours. No anger. No excuses. Just a weary resignation. The kind that comes from decisions already made long before they were spoken aloud.</p>
  
    <p>You didn’t scream. You didn’t argue. The house stayed quiet, like it didn’t want to know what would happen next.</p>
  
    <p>By the time the sun crept through the blinds, the only thing left moving was your breath.</p>
  
    <p>The ticket was warm in your palm. The body beneath you wasn’t.</p>
