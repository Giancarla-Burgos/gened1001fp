April XX —

I've been watching them again. The others. They came here thinking they'd outrun it: the virus, the fear, themselves. But it’s always people who bring the rot, not the air.

Back home, I tried so hard to be good. I kept lists, shared food, swallowed my voice. Here, I see that perfection was never real. It was a shape I twisted into to survive.

I miss my brother. I even miss her. But I don’t miss the weight of needing to be loved for being good, for being little miss perfect. I feel that liberation deep within my bones.

This place is no sanctuary. They feed us lies and calls for obedience. They're burning exo-creatures, humans like me, anything they can find to do even the most menial tasks. I've seen the vats. I've read the logs, the livestock sales will never sit well with me. The ticket wasn't a rescue, it was just another invitation to become complicit to more of these atrocities.

Today, I chose not to be another sheep in the masses.

Maybe they'll say I gave up. Maybe they won’t say anything at all.

But I know this: the apocalypse was never the end. It was the truth getting louder.

I won't forget who I was trying to be. But I won't pretend it was enough.

So here’s my last entry.

This is me, as honest as I'll ever be.
