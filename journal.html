  <h1>Journal Entry – April XX</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    I’ve been watching the footage on the news. The Korinthians with their chants and incense and torn robes, huddled in the streets, whispering about flames and judgment.
    
    “The Rapture,” they call it, like this was prophesied and deserved.

    Sometimes I wonder if they wanted this, if believing in a cleansing made them manifest it. Sometimes I wonder if they created it. It can't be bigotry when you see your own neighbors crossing the street, 
    preaching sermons about the Holiness of this event when poor souls are being isolated because they're not only threats to society but threats to themselves, forgetting not only memories, but becoming such animalistic brutes, how do you not start drawing lines?

    I also feel a different fear under that anger. A fear of what it would mean for these wretched, biased beliefs to be right.
    
    If the time comes, and I have to choose who to save, how do I even begin to answer that?
    My spouse is brave, and they'd tell me not to think like this, but they've recently been getting that distant look in their eyes, like they're somewhere faraway.
    My daughter is soft but smarter than she lets on. She stopped asking for things the day she saw the news and has been voluteering for humanitarian causes.
    My son is my pride, but he's made himself so scarce these days with those med school applications. Sometimes I wonder if he's still in there.
    
    And me? I’m the one writing all this down in the dark, pretending that writing it makes it more human and less like calculation.

    I’m scared I already made up my mind.
    I’m scared I won’t be strong enough to follow through.
    I’m scared that deep down, none of us are innocent, and this is our true final judgement.
