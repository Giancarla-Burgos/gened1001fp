    <h1>Salvation</h1>

    <p>The air on the new world is sterile and cold, recycled too many times over skin that no longer flinches. The walls hum, low and constant. Every room is clean, labeled, numbered. Efficient. There are no windows here. There is no need for them.</p>

    <p>You were given clearance to access the main registry — a privilege for surviving, they said. For choosing correctly. You scroll through names you no longer recognize, blinking green next to "Processed." Every so often, one catches your eye, but the feeling fades before it takes root.</p>

    <p>The energy core requires organic heat. That’s what they called it. Heat. Not people. But you know better. You always did.</p>

    <p>You find them eventually. Your daughter. Your son. Slot A4-322 and A4-323. Units pending. Your fingers trace the screen. You pause. Then you move on.</p>

    <p>You’re escorted back to the cafeteria. Today’s meal is labeled “protein variant, spiced.” You eat without thinking. The food is bland, but warm. That’s enough.</p>

    <p>Someone asks if you're feeling okay. You smile and say yes. Because what else is there to feel?</p>
